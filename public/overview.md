# Cards

## Game cards

- Each different card name represents someone at the royal residence.

- Each card has a number in the upper left corner -> The higher the number, the closer the person is to the Princess.

- At the bottom is a text box, that describes the effect that occurs when the card is discarded.

## Reference cards

- Not used for the game itself, but are provided as a memory aid for the players.

## Tokens of affection

- Red, heart-shaped

- Used to track the Princess ever-growing affection for the suitors whose letters reach her.

- Jesters token is not red.

# Setup

- Shuffle following cards in the deck:
  - Princess
  - Countess
  - King
  - Prince (2x)
  - Handmaid (2x)
  - Baron (2x)
  - Priest (2x)
  - Guard (5x)
- Remove the top card from the deck without looking at it and place it face-down on the table.
  - During a 2-player game, remove the top 3 cards from the deck and placed it face-up on the table to examine them.
- Each player draws a card from the deck. This is the player's starting hand and is kept secret from other players.
- The player who won the last round goes first. If it is the first round, whoever was most recently on a date goes first (if tied, the youngest player wins the tie). The last rule also applies if more than one player won the last round.

# Game play

- The game is round-based.
- Each round represents one day.
- At the end of each day, one player's letter reaches the Princess and she reads it.
- When she ready enough letters from one suitor, shw becomes enamored and grants that suitor permission to court her (this is the end of the game).

## Taking a turn

- On a player's turn, they draw a card from the deck and add it to their hand.
- Then, they choose one of the two cards in their hand and discard it face-up in front of them.
- The effect of the card will be applied to them immediately.
- Discarded cards are not removed from the table. This will help other players deduce which cards the other players are holding.
- The player's turn ends and the next player takes their turn (left player).

## Out of the round

- If a player is out of the round, they do not take any more turns.
- The player will discard the cards in his or her hand face-up in front of them (the affects of the cards are not applied).

## Honesty

- Friendly reminder to not lie about the cards in your hand.

## Choosing a player

- Some cards require the player to choose another player.
- If the required player to choose is blocked by an other card or effect, the card will be discarded without any effect.

## End of a round

- A round ends if the deck is empty at the end of a player's turn.
- All player are required to discard their card face-up in front of them.
- The player closest to the Princess (highest number on card) delivers the love letter to her and wins the round.
  - If there is a tie, the player's will add the numbers on the card in their discard pile and the player with the highest total wins.
  - If there is still a tie, all tied players win.
- A round can also be won, if all other players are out of the round but one (the remaining player wins of course).
- The winner of the round will receive a token of affection from the Princess.
- All cards are shuffled and a new round begins.

## End of the game

- You win the game if you win enough rounds to collect enough tokens of affection from the Princess.
  - 2 players: 7 tokens
  - 3 players: 5 tokens
  - 4 players: 4 tokens

# About the people

## 8: Princess Annette

Effect:

If you discard the Princess — no matter how or why — she has tossed your letter into the fire. You are immediately knocked out of the round. If the Princess was discarded by a card effect, any remaining effects of that card do not apply (you do not draw a card from the Prince, for example). Effects tied to being knocked out the round still apply (eg. Constable, Jester), however.

## 7: Countess Wilhelmina

Effect:

Unlike other cards, which take effect when discarded, the text on the Countess applies while she is in your hand. In fact, the only time it doesn’t apply is when you discard her. If you ever have the Countess and either the King or Prince in your hand, you must discard the Countess. You do not have to reveal the other card in your hand. Of course, you can also discard the Countess even if you do not have a royal family member in your hand. The Countess likes to play mind games...

## 6: King Arnaud IV

Effect:

When you discard King Arnaud IV, trade the card in your hand with the card held by another player of your choice. You cannot trade with a player who is out of the round.

## 5: Prince Arnaud

Effect:

When you discard Prince Arnaud, choose one player still in the round (including yourself). That player discards his or her hand (but doesn’t apply its effect, unless it is the Princess, see page 8) and draws a new one. If the deck is empty and the player cannot draw a card, that player draws the card that was removed at the start of the round. If all other players are protected by the Handmaid, you must choose yourself.

## 4: Handmaid Susannah

Effect:

When you discard the Handmaid, you are immune to the effects of other players’ cards until the start of your next turn. If all players other than the player whose turn it is are protected by the Handmaid, the player must choose him- or herself for a card’s effects, if possible.

## 3: Baron Talus

Effect:

When you discard the Baron, choose another player still in the round. You and that player secretly compare your hands. The player with the lower number is knocked out of the round. In case of a tie, nothing happens.

## 2: Priest Tomas

Effect:

When you discard the Priest, you can look at another player’s hand. Do not reveal the hand to any other players

## 1: Guard Odette

Effect:

When you discard the Guard, choose a player and name a number (other than 1). If that player has that number in their hand, that player is knocked out of the round. If all other players still in the round cannot be chosen (eg. due to Handmaid or Sycophant), this card is discarded without eect
